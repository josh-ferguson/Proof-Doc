# Proof-Doc
This web application was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows the users to upload a document to the website. Reviewers can then proofread and comment
on the document. Then users can access the proofreaders comments and make adjustments to their work.

## The Problem to be Solved
The project focuses on the problem of students being disadvantaged due to poor literacy levels. The main categories of students this relates to are those with learning disabilities and international students. These students with some minor difficulties in writing should not be penalised unduly, and may have significant academic ability that may be hidden as a result of poor written English.
